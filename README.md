This fork of the very useful [antimatter webGL Gaussian Splat viewer](https://antimatter15.com/splat/) exists to help spread the word about new techniques for digitally preserving historic abandoned buildings. The upstream project code will be adjusted slightly to display some captures we made at Kings Park Psychiatric Center and redirect visitors to our resources over on [abandoned.zone](https://abandoned.zone)
